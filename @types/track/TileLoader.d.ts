 * # Tile Request Manager
 *
 * If a user is navigating around then many requests may be started but the most recently started request are the highest priority as these correspond to regions currently visible
 * Once a browser request has been created we cannot deprioritise it if we decide a new request should take precedence. To work around this we create a request stack (that's dequeued
 * in order of the most recently enqueued).
 *
 * The manager allows a small number of concurrent requests (a limitation also provided by the browser), when request finishes and slot opens up, the executed request is the one
 * most recently pushed to the stack.
 *
 * If request management is done at a global level so it potentially includes requests made by other genome browsers active at the same time.
